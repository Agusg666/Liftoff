# Liftoff Maps

## What have we got here then?

* A list of good maps played by ourselves for within LiftOff.
* Config files for the Player.xml - hopefully to improve the flying experience.

# Instructions

We have copied the folder structure for LiftOff to make it easier to use.

> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Liftoff\Liftoff_Data

Example above showing a Windows path.

If you have no *Tracks* folder, then go ahead and create one.

If you are wanting to use a Player config, please make sure you rename it to Player.xml
